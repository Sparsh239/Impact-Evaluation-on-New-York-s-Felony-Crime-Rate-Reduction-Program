# Impact-Evaluation-on-New-York-s-Felony-Crime-Rate-Reduction-Program

# **Executive Summary**
Back in January 2010, the NYC District Attorney's office implemented a program designed to reduce the felony re-arrest rates city wide. The individuals arrested after the implementation of the program in certain precincts were provided with on-spot intervention by New York Policy Department. The DA's office hopes providing interventions will reduce the probability of arrested individuals committing a felony crime in the next one year. This repository evaluates the impact of the program developed by NYC District Attorney's office and recommends continuing the program after evaluating its impact on the felony re-arrest rate employing the probit regression model on the provided data.

Data contains information on the crime arrest made from 2008 â€“ 2011, including their crime-type (felony, misdemeanor), arrest-date, treatment group (treatment, control), and demographics (gender, age, precinct). Exploratory data analysis on both crime and demographic-based features offers a graphical and tabular description of the data and its distribution. Further, statistical tests spearman, Mann- Whitney, chi-square and independent t-test, measures the correlation and association between the indicators depending upon their types. Keeping the analytical test results and assumptions in mind, the analysis employs probit regression to find the significant signs influencing the chances of felony re-arrest rate in one year after January 2010. The model demonstrated that individuals in the treatment groups have a 16.7 percent lower probability of committing a felony re-arrest rate in the next year, holding other variables constant. People arrested with a misdemeanor crime when provided with onspot intervention on average have an approximate 23 percent higher chance of felony re-arrest without any other variable influence. Similarly, age, irrespective of other indicators, increases the likelihood of felony re-arrest by 3.5 percent.

# **Instructions**
##data_wrangling.csv
1. ***Read the datasets***
There are three datasets required in this analysis:
>> **arrest.csv**
>>> *Contains information on the arrests made from 2008 to 2011*
>>>> - **person_id** : Unique identification for each individuals
>>>> - **arrest_date** : Arrest Date
>>>> - **arrest_id** : Arrest ID for each arrest made. Note, there are more than one arrest id for each    >>>>                   person id, if arrested more than once
>>>> - **law_code** : Type of Crime (Misdemeanor and Felony)

>> **demo.csv**
>>> *Demographic information of the people arrested*
>>>> - **person_id** : Unique identification for each individuals
>>>> - **gender** : Gender of the person arrested
>>>> - **bdate** : Birth Date of the person arrested
>>>> - **home_precinct** : Precinct number of the place where the arrests took place.

>> **treatment_assignment.csv**
>>> *Contains information on the precinct and treatment status (Treatment or Control)*
>>>> - **precinct** : Precinct number of the place where the arrests took place.
>>>> - **Treatment Status** : Treatment Status of the Precinct (Treatment or Control). Certain precincts >>>>                          were provided treatment and others were part of control group
2. Calculate the date 6 months ago and 2 years ago
>>>> `from dateutil.relativedelta import *
dataframe['date_column'] = pd.to_datetime(dataframe['date_column'] ,format='%Y/%m/%d') # Converts the arrest date into a date time format
dataframe['date_column_six_months_ago'] = dataframe['date_column'].apply(lambda x:x - relativedelta(months = 6)) # `
