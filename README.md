# Impact-Evaluation-on-New-York-s-Felony-Crime-Rate-Reduction-Program
Back in January 2010, the NYC District Attorney;s office implemented a program designed to reduce the felony re-arrest rates city wide. The individuals arrested after the implementation of the program, were provided with on-spot intervention by New York Policy Department. The DA's office hopes providing interventions will reduce the probability of arrested individuals committing a felony crime in the next one year. This repository evaluates the impact of the program developed by NYC District Attorney's office.

## **Summary**

> This memo recommends continuing the program implemented by NYC District Attorney’s (DA’s) Oﬃce after evaluating its impact on the felony re-arrest rate employing the probit regression model on the provided data. Data contained information on the crime arrest made from 2008 – 2011, including their crime-type (felony, misdemeanor), arrest-date, treatment group (treatment, control), and demographics (gender, age, precinct). Exploratory data analysis on both crime and demographic-based features offers a graphical and tabular description of the data and its distribution. Further, statistical tests spearman, Mann- Whitney, chi-square and independent t-test, measures the correlation and association between the indicators depending upon their types. Keeping the analytical test results and assumptions in mind, I employed probit regression to find the significant signs influencing the chances of felony re-arrest rate in one year after January 2010. The model demonstrated that individuals in the treatment groups have a 16.7 percent lower probability of committing a felony re-arrest rate in the next year, holding other variables constant. People arrested with a misdemeanor crime when provided with onspot intervention on average have an approximate 23 percent higher chance of felony re-arrest without any other variable influence. Similarly, age, irrespective of other indicators, increases the likelihood of felony re-arrest by 3.5 percent.
